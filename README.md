Users can make a new post and get a confirmation screen upon success:

The main page is a feed of submitted images. After uploading more pictures, "people walking" is at the top:

## extra front-end
1. Overrote bootstrap scss to have pink colors
2. Added white border to images
3. Sorted images by submission date - newest on the top (newer posts take priority)

Done with chrome developer tools and googling to figure out what to override because I didn't want to create a new theme entirely:
